Write an algorithm to determine if a number n is "happy".

A happy number is a number defined by the following process: Starting with any positive integer, replace the number by the sum of the squares of its digits, and repeat the process until the number equals 1 (where it will stay), or it loops endlessly in a cycle which does not include 1. Those numbers for which this process ends in 1 are happy numbers.

Return True if n is a happy number, and False if not.

class Solution:
    def isHappy(self, n: int) -> bool:
        seen={}
        while True:
            n=self.helper(n)
            temp = sum([a**2 for a in n])
            if temp==1:
                return True
            elif temp in seen:
                return False
            else:
                seen[temp]=0
                n=(self.helper(temp))
                n=[str(a) for a in n]
                n=int("".join(n))
        return False
            
    def helper(self,n):
        n = list(str(n))
        n = [int(x) for x in n]
        return n
